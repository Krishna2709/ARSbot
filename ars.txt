Is medical detox right for me?
Medically supervised detox may be required to safely stop using drugs or alcohol if any of the following is true:

I’ve tried stopping by myself before and it didn’t work
I use drugs or drink alcohol to avoid uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms
I’ve used drugs or alcohol in large amounts or for a long time
I’m addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines, where withdrawal symptoms can be fatal







What’s Included In Our Detox Program


Upon arrival at our facility, we complete a comprehensive assessment of each patient’s drug and alcohol use, physical and mental condition, and any co-occurring disorders. This evaluation allows us to develop a customized treatment plan for their medical detox.
During detox, medications are administered as medically appropriate to alleviate withdrawal symptoms, and nutritious meals are provided to support overall health and healing.

About Drug and Alcohol Detox
During medical detoxification, our medical professionals supervise the elimination process of alcohol and/or drugs from the patient’s system. They monitor and help manage withdrawal symptoms, which can be uncomfortable or even life-threatening, depending on the substance(s) used and for how long.
Starting treatment with medical detox is recommended due to the increased comfort and safety it provides. A successful medical detox can set the tone for the patient’s recovery journey.




Who Needs Medically Supervised Drug and Alcohol Detox?

Someone who has used a substance heavily and/or for an extended time is likely to need medical detox for their comfort and safety. Detox care is likely necessary if someone has been taking one of these:
Benzodiazepines
Alcohol
Heroin or opioids
Stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamine



Why Is Medical Drug and Alcohol Detox Necessary?

Even for those with supportive loved ones, the detox process can be very challenging and vulnerable time. Completing a medical detox gives the patient 24-hour support through difficult situations and sets the stage to start the recovery process.



How Does Medically Monitored Drug and Alcohol Detox Work?

Medical detox works by providing supervision and support while the patient’s body is removing all traces of drugs and alcohol. Medical professionals monitor the patient for symptoms of withdrawal and can act swiftly to address them or assist the patient in working through them. This is especially important when patients have developed physical dependence on substances and experience painful or dangerous withdrawal. Additionally, in medical detox, the patient is removed from their normal circumstances and triggers so that they can focus on healing and starting life in recovery. 



How long is medical detox?

The duration of medical detox varies depending on several factors such as the substance(s) used, withdrawal symptoms, and the patient’s overall health. Generally, our patients complete medically supervised detox within 5-7 days.



Can I detox at home?

Medically-supervised detox is the best way to ensure comfort and safety. For this reason, we strongly discourage at-home detox. Withdrawal can be challenging and discouraging, which can increase the risk of relapse and overdose. Additionally, some substances, including alcohol and benzodiazepines, can have life-threatening withdrawal symptoms that require immediate medical attention.



Is Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) available? 

Advanced Recovery Systems facilities offer medication-assisted treatment, as medically appropriate.



Does insurance cover medical detox?

Insurance may cover some or all of the medical detox costs. Our facilities can also work with patients without insurance to develop private payment options.

Knowing when it’s time for inpatient treatment

Alcohol or drug abuse has made my life worse
Avoiding triggering people or places while I recover would help
My home feels unstable or makes me want to drink or use drugs
I’ve tried outpatient rehab before, but it didn’t work






What Does Our Inpatient Rehab Include?


Inpatient rehab empowers you with the tools, awareness and support you need to live a sober happy life.

About Inpatient Rehab
Inpatient rehabilitation, also called inpatient rehab or residential treatment, is a level of addiction treatment where patients stay on-site at one of our facilities to focus on stopping their drug and alcohol use and committing to a long-term recovery plan. Inpatient rehab usually starts after detox is completed, and is often followed by step-down programs like a partial hospitalization program or outpatient treatment.



How long is inpatient rehab?
While the length of treatment depends on a multitude of factors including the patient’s substance use history and overall health, most patients finish our medical detox and inpatient rehab programs in 20–35 days.

Can I leave inpatient rehab when I want?
Patients have the right to leave rehab at any time, as long as they are not a danger to themselves or others, even against medical advice. However, we recommend completing the full treatment plan in order to minimize the risk of relapse and/or overdose.

Does inpatient rehab work?
Yes, inpatient addiction treatment has been the starting point for many of our patient’s long-term recovery journeys. Substance use disorders do not have a “cure,” recovery is possible. We measure the success of inpatient rehabilitation based on several factors, including improvements in patients’ physical and mental health, employment or educational status, relapse time, safety and legal status, and the quality of relationships with their loved ones.

How can I pay for inpatient rehab?
Insurance may cover some or all of the inpatient rehab costs. Our facilities can also work with patients without insurance to develop a private pay option.

I’ve finished inpatient rehab and want to keep going with my care
I have a mild substance use disorder or addiction 
My loved ones give me a safe, supportive home life

About Outpatient Rehab
Outpatient rehab can be the continuation of a treatment plan started in an inpatient rehab or a starting point for patients who require the flexibility to continue working or handling other responsibilities. These patients continue to live at home and commute to the center for medical support and counseling appointments.




What are the benefits of outpatient rehab?

Outpatient treatment can be beneficial if you’re unable to take time away from work, school or other responsibilities to start treatment. It’s also beneficial as a transition from inpatient care back to your normal life, as it offers accountability and support from mental health professionals. Another benefit is that it’s typically less expensive than inpatient rehab treatment.



What will I learn from outpatient rehab?

While your specific treatment plan should be tailored to meet your unique needs, two common areas covered in outpatient rehab are relapse prevention and strengthening the skills learned in previous inpatient treatment. Other topics covered, either in individual or group settings, could include:
Challenges in early recovery
12-step programs
Relapse prevention and dealing with cravings
Mental health
Stress management
Family systems
Rebuilding relationships
Developing healthy habits
Returning to school or work
Co-occurring disorders



How long is outpatient rehab?

The amount of time it takes to complete outpatient rehab varies for each individual based on a number of factors, but most of our patients complete their outpatient treatment program within a span of 1 to 3 months, although it can extend up to a year.



Is drug or alcohol detox included?

Medical detox is not provided as part of outpatient rehab. Those in need of detox would need to complete that program prior to beginning outpatient care.



Does outpatient rehab work?

Yes, outpatient rehab can be an effective way to begin a long-lasting recovery journey. While substance use disorders have no “cure,” recovery is possible. Our patients have reported notable enhancements in their physical and mental well-being, relationships with loved ones, safety, legal status, employment or educational status, and time before relapse as a result of their treatment with us.



Is transportation provided for outpatient rehab?

No, transportation is not provided to or from outpatient rehab appointments. If you have any in-person appointments at one of our offices, it is your responsibility to arrange transportation to and from the facility.



How can I pay for outpatient rehab?

Outpatient rehab costs may be covered in part or in full by insurance; however, copays and meeting deductibles could be required. For those who do not have insurance, our facilities can discuss an affordable payment plan with you.
