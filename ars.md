## About Inpatient Rehab
Inpatient rehabilitation, also called inpatient rehab or residential treatment, is a level of addiction treatment where patients stay on-site at one of our facilities to focus on stopping their drug and alcohol use and committing to a long-term recovery plan. Inpatient rehab usually starts after detox is completed, and is often followed by step-down programs like a partial hospitalization program or outpatient treatment.

### How long is inpatient rehab?
The length of treatment depends on a multitude of factors including the patient’s substance use history and overall health, most patients finish our medical detox and inpatient rehab programs in 20–35 days.

### Can I leave inpatient rehab when I want?
Patients have the right to leave rehab at any time, as long as they are not a danger to themselves or others, even against medical advice. However, we recommend completing the full treatment plan in order to minimize the risk of relapse and/or overdose.

### Does inpatient rehab work?
Yes, inpatient addiction treatment has been the starting point for many of our patient’s long-term recovery journeys. Substance use disorders do not have a “cure,” recovery is possible. We measure the success of inpatient rehabilitation based on several factors, including improvements in patients’ physical and mental health, employment or educational status, relapse time, safety and legal status, and the quality of relationships with their loved ones.

### How can I pay for inpatient rehab?
Insurance may cover some or all of the inpatient rehab costs. Our facilities can also work with patients without insurance to develop a private pay option.

## About Outpatient Rehab
Outpatient rehab can be the continuation of a treatment plan started in an inpatient rehab or a starting point for patients who require the flexibility to continue working or handling other responsibilities. These patients continue to live at home and commute to the center for medical support and counseling appointments.

### What are the benefits of outpatient rehab?
Outpatient treatment can be beneficial if you’re unable to take time away from work, school or other responsibilities to start treatment. It’s also beneficial as a transition from inpatient care back to your normal life, as it offers accountability and support from mental health professionals. Another benefit is that it’s typically less expensive than inpatient rehab treatment.

### What will I learn from outpatient rehab?
While your specific treatment plan should be tailored to meet your unique needs, two common areas covered in outpatient rehab are relapse prevention and strengthening the skills learned in previous inpatient treatment. Other topics covered, either in individual or group settings, could include:
- Challenges in early recovery
- 12-step programs

### Is drug or alcohol detox included?
Medical detox is not provided as part of outpatient rehab. Those in need of detox would need to complete that program prior to beginning outpatient care.

### Does outpatient rehab work?
Yes, outpatient rehab can be an effective way to begin a long-lasting recovery journey. While substance use disorders have no “cure,” recovery is possible. Our patients have reported notable enhancements in their physical and mental well-being, relationships with loved ones, safety, legal status, employment or educational status, and time before relapse as a result of their treatment with us.
